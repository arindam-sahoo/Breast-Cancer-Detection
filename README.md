## Breast Cancer Prediction
In this repository, I have developed a Breast cancer Prediction System using Logistic Regression. We will use Logistic Regression to classify and predict breast cancer.

## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1.

## Why have I used logistic regression in this project?
Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical, such as to predict whether the tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).

## Why I found Logistic Regression to be preferrable in this project?
Logistic regression analysis is valuable for predicting the likelihood of an event. It helps determine the probabilities between any two classes by analyzing or training on historical data.
