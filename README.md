## About the Project
In this repository, I have developed a Breast cancer Prediction System using Logistic Regression. We will use Logistic Regression to classify and predict breast cancer.

## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1.

## Why have I used logistic regression in this project?
Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical, such as to predict whether the tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).

## Why I found Logistic Regression to be preferrable in this project?
Logistic regression analysis is valuable for predicting the likelihood of an event. It helps determine the probabilities between any two classes by analyzing or training on historical data.

Scikit Learn is a Python module integrating classical machine
learning algorithms in the tightly-knit world of scientific Python
packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib).

It aims to provide simple and efficient solutions to learning problems
that are accessible to everybody and reusable in various contexts:
machine-learning as a versatile tool for science and engineering.</p>

Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data
structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both
easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for
doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has
the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data
analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on
its way toward this goal.
